When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to keep a backup for safety sake.  When other people are helping
    me with it or giving me feedback on it.  When in a work evironment and I
    am a part of a team working on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes you want to work on a branch that you do not want to
    affect your master on the remote repo.  You have more control that way.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a copy of a repo on GitHub that is also on GitHub under your name
    now.  A clone is a copy of a repo from a GitHub to your local computer.  You
    can also clone from a local repo to another file on your computer, which is
    effectively the same as a fork, except a fork is only possible on GitHub.  A
    fork keeps track of who you copied the repository from. A
    branch is when you make a copy of the content of a repo but it is still
    a part of the repo and can be merged back into it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can be notified when your current commit needs to be merged to the remote
    and it will keep showing how your modifications are different from origin.
